# Overview

{I learned about how to write function and create and pass variable, and the class function help me a little bit to keep the data that I don' want to change into private
also I learned about data structure but I don't really need to use it in my software so.}

{I want to practice the code part of a project that I want to make in the future, a window opener to save me from summer weather.}
